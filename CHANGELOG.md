# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Show VCS change markers in the gutter of the decrypted editor, comparing the decrypted content with the
  decrypted content of the last commit.
- Compare the decrypted contents of the files that are being compared, switching between the decrypted
  and the encrypted contents from the toolbar of the comparison window. The setting `Decrypt contents
  in the comparison and merge windows` decides which of the two a window starts with.
- Resolve merge conflicts in the decrypted contents of the files that are being merged, encrypting the
  merged contents back into the file when the merge is applied.

### Fixed

- Decrypt the content of the last commit with the store of the file it comes from, instead of always
  decrypting it as YAML.
